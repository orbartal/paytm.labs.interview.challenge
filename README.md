# paytm.labs.interview.challenge
An interview test for a job at paytm labs

See description of the exercise:
https://github.com/PaytmLabs/SoftwareChalleng

Note: This code is open source for others to learn from it. 
However please do not try to use it to solve the same exercise. 
Because paytm have automated tests to prove any act of deception. 
And because it is not nice to cheat in a job test.
